<- Vertex ----------------------------------------------------------------------
This class handles mathematical vertexes.

An instance is constructed with a dictionary containing 'x', 'y', and 'z'. Sometimes also contained are 'w' which represents the length (default = 1), and 'color' which represents the color (default = new white).

This class does not have public methods, so essentially each Vertex is immutable.

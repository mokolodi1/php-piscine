42 PHP Piscine

This is a giant folder containing all of the work that I did during the PHP pool at 42.
Each dXX folder represents a day, and the rushes were conducted during each weekend.
(There were no 'day' projects on Saturday or Sunday.) 
Each day opens at 9 am the day of and finishes at 11:42 the following day.
While technically each day was open for 38 hours and 42 minutes, a new day came out every 24 hours.
The rushes opened on Friday at 8 pm and closed on Sunday at 11:42 pm.

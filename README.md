42 PHP Piscine

This is a giant folder containing all of the work that I did during the PHP pool at 42.
Each dXX folder represents a day, and the rushes were conducted during each weekend.
(There were no 'day' projects on Saturday or Sunday.) 
Each day opens at 9 am the day of and finishes at 11:42 the following day.
While technically each day was open for 38 hours and 42 minutes, a new day came out every 24 hours.
The rushes opened on Friday at 8 pm and closed on Sunday at 11:42 pm. 

I had never done any work in web or PHP before the pool, so everything was completely new. I did, however, have experience in object oriented design (or in French, "POO"), which proved very useful for d06 and onwards.

Grid is 150 by 100
Enemies start in opposite corners
There have to be obstacles to stop the ships from moving around/allow them to hide from fire
A boat that leaves the board or that touches an obstacle is eliminated

The players take turns activating their ships
Ships have to do the following in this order:
- order phase
- movement phase
- firing phase
As soon as all the ships have been activated, a new turn starts

Ship characteristics:
- name
- size
- sprite
- health points (5 a good average)
- PP (points de puissance): to go faster, to reinforce shields, to feed the crew (10 a good average)
- speed (can be raised using PP) (scout = 20, huge = 10)
- manuverability: number of squares straight to turn right or left; amount of inertia
- shield: amount of damange it can take before losing health (0 at activation, can be increased with PP)
- weapons: each ship has one or two weapons, damage given by PP

Order phase
- all PP given out in the previous turn set to 0
- 1PP to speed allows 1D6 more movement
- 1PP to shields adds one shield point
- 1PP to weapons allows 1D6 fires with that weapon
- to heal: ship must not move; 1PP = 1D6 of health (1 point restored with a 6)

Movement phrase
- a turn turns the ship 90 degrees either direction
- a ship turns around the middle of the ship
- a ship not moving can turn once for free before starting to move
- a ship can only move the number of squares corresponding to speed
- a ship must always move a number of squares greater than or equal to its characteristic manouver (??)
- if a ship moves exactly the number of times it moved last turn, it can stay still
- a ship not moving can stay that way
- a non-moving ship can only move less than it's characteristic manouver. If it does this it will not be considered not moving next turn.
- a ship can turn each time it moves more than it's manuverability score
- a ship that hits another stops immidiately and cannot move anymore nor shoot (it will be immobile next turn) (it also takes some damage: page 9, second to last paragraph)
- a ship that hits an obstacle or exits the playing area is destroyed and eliminated

Firing phase
- each PP gives another 1D6 for that weapon
- certain weapons have a number of charges by default at the beginning of each turn
- to fire, the ship must have a line of sight to the target
- given a line of sight, the number of dice is equal to the charges for that weapon
- the success rates are defined as (short range = 4+; medium range = 5+; long range = 6)
- each I need to reread the last bit
